    question: "How does the editing and payment process work for videos?",
    answer: "Once you send us your script and voiceover, you will pay us half of the agreed upon price. We'll begin working on your video and keep you updated throughout the process. We will then deliver a watermarked draft for your review within the agreed timeframe. We'll make the changes you request and deliver the final product, but with a watermark. You will then pay us the remaining half of the agreed upon price, after which you will receive the full, watermark-free video."

    question: "How does the designing and payment process work for thumbnails?",
    answer: "Similarily to videos, you will pay us half of the agreed upon price. We'll then begin designing your thumbnails and keep you updated throughout the process. Once you're happy with the watermarked design, you will pay us the remaining half of the agreed upon price. After which you will receive the full, watermark-free design."

    question: "Do you offer revisions?",
    answer: "Yes! We will work with you to tweak and change anything you're unhappy with until you are completely satisfied with the final product. Depending on the size of the changes, this may require additional payments (at the agreed upon rate per hour, or per design for thumbnails)."
